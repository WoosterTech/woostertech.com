## The "Why"

I used to pay Zoho for their **Desk** product (I don't remember what level) that included a custom domain. This was also before my \[switch to Netlify]\({{ ref "/blog/new-website" }}) so my [https://support.woostertech.com](https://support.woostertech.com) URL was not going to work. I did have to have Zoho remove my domain entirely since my DNS settings weren't correct and I could no longer access the portal at all!

What I didn't want, however, was to have to give customers and clients the entire non-custom URL [https://desk.zoho.com/support/woostertech](https://desk.zoho.com/support/woostertech "https://desk.zoho.com/support/woostertech").
